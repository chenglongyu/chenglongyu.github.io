<li><B>Grading</B>: The grades are based on 5% Lab + 20% Homework + 20% first midterm +20% second midterm + 35% final exam.

<p> </ul>
<br><B>Syllabus</B>: This is the second half of a year long course in algebra, with emphasis on topics concerning groups, rings and fields. 
We will cover symmetry (chapter 6), advanced group theory including the Sylow's theorems (chapter 7), some fundamentals on rings and modules (chapter 11, 12, 14), basics on fields and Galois theory (chapter 15, 16) and 
some optional topics including Lie group (chapter 9), representation theory (chapter 10). The basics of linear algebra (as covered in Math 370) will be assumed.

<br>
<br>
The goal of the class is to develop intuition from concrete examples and apply the power of abstraction to solve problems.
