\begin{ex}
 Prove that the map $a\mapsto a^{-1}$ is a group isomorphism of $G$ to itself if and only if $G$ is abelian. 
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
 Find all subgroups of $D_4$ of order $4$. (In class I listed two of them, but there is a third one that I missed. Thank the students who pointed it out to me.)
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
    Prove that all the subgroups of $(\Z,+)$ have the form $n\Z$ for some integer $n\geq 0$.
\end{ex}


\begin{ex}
Let $G$ be the subset of $\GL(2, \rr)$ consisting of matrices 
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
    a     & -b \\
     b   & a 
\end{bmatrix}\]
with $a^2+b^2\neq 0$. Prove that $G$ is a subgroup of $\GL(2, \R)$ and isomorphic to $\C^\times$. Here $\C^\times$ is the multiplicative group of nonzero complex numbers, and $\GL(2, \R)$ is the group of invertible $2\times 2$ matrices with real entries. Is $G$ a normal subgroup of $\GL(2, \R)$?

Furthermore, if $a,b$ have the form $a=\cos \theta$ and $b=\sin \theta$, prove these matrices also form a subgroup of $\GL(2, \R)$ and it is isomorphic to $\U(1)$. 

\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Let $G$ be a group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. Assume that the number of elements in $G/H$ is $2$. Prove that $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Let $G=\{(a,b)\vert a,b \in \mathbb{R}, a\neq 0\}$. Define a binary operation on $G$ as $(a,b)\cdot (c,d)=(ac,ad+b)$. Prove that $G$ is a group with this operation. 
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
In this question, you will explore the conditions under which the group is isomorphic to a product group. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be two groups with identity elements $e_1$ and $e_2$, and $G$ is the product group $G=G_1\times G_2$. Prove that $G_1\times \{e_2\}$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and isomorphic to $G_1$. Similarly, $\{e_1\}\times G_2$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and isomorphic to $G_2$. The intersection of these two normal subgroups is $\{(e_1,e_2)\}$, the identity element of $G$.
    
    \item Let $H$ and $K$ be two normal subgroups of a group $G$ such that $H\cap K=\{e\}$, the identity element of $G$. Prove that the subset $HK=\{hk\vert h\in H, k\in K\}$ is a subgroup of $G$ and isomorphic to the product group $H\times K$. If we assume that $HK=G$, then we can say that $G$ is isomorphic to the product group $H\times K$. (Hint: first you can show that the elements from $H$ and $K$ commute with each other, i.e., for any $h\in H$ and $k\in K$, we have $hk=kh$. Then you can use the first part of this question to show that the map \[H\times K\to HK, (h,k)\mapsto hk\] is a group isomorphism from $H\times K$ to $HK$.)
\end{enumerate}
